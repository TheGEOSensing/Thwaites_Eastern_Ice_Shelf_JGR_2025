**Overview**
The project investigates the progressive fracturing of the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf (TEIS) from 2002 to 2022 using:
	‚Ä¢	Satellite remote sensing (Landsat, Sentinel-1)
	‚Ä¢	In-situ GPS measurements from AMIGOS stations
	‚Ä¢	Statistical and geospatial analyses for fracture propagation and ice-flow dynamics
We provide processing scripts, analysis routines, and visualization tools used to produce the figures and results in the paper that contents
	‚Ä¢	Data Processing: Preprocessing of satellite imagery, fracture digitization, and velocity data
	‚Ä¢	Analysis Scripts: Statistical trends, strain-rate calculations, and time-series analysis
	‚Ä¢	Visualization: Figure generation for publication-quality outputs
	‚Ä¢	Supporting Functions: Helper scripts for geospatial data handling and mapping
All scripts are provided in MATLAB (.m) format
